    "## When Enforcers Defect\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traders Guild operated across Densworld for centuries, facilitating commerce between regions with vastly different conditions. In stable territories near the Capital, guild rules worked: inspectors verified goods, penalties deterred fraud, and disputes were resolved through established procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the Guild expanded into the Western Reaches and Threshold — territories near the Dens, where conditions were volatile. Prices shifted without explanation. Goods transmuted in transit. Contracts became ambiguous when the very properties they described changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital's response was more enforcement: more inspectors, harsher penalties, mandatory documentation. But enforcement requires enforcers who are honest. Near the Dens, inspectors could be bribed. Reports vanished. Penalties were applied inconsistently — or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brenn Auster**, a guild economist, noticed the deeper problem: the enforcement system itself was a game where defection could be profitable. Inspectors who took bribes earned more than honest ones. Traders who cheated and bribed the inspector paid less than traders who played fair. The system *incentivized* the behavior it was designed to prevent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auster proposed a radical alternative: **design the rules so that honesty is the cheapest strategy.** Not because enforcers are watching — because the mathematics make cheating unprofitable regardless."

    "4. **Quantify the enforcement gap** — where rules fail, and why more rules won't help\n",
